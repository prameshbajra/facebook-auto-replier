Obviously, facebook email and password is needed.

Pull that from the `.env` file.
You will need to create this file in the root directory with content like:

```
MESSAGE_USERS={"USERNAME":"USERID", "USERNAME": "USERID2"}
FB_EMAIL=<EMAIL>
FB_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
```

> USERID will be in the format 10000XXXXXX.


No need to say this but you will need to run `npm install` for sure.
